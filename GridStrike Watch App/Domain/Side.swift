//  Marks which half of the board owns a tile or initiates an attack. The map is
//  symmetric: rows 0–5 belong to `.opponent`, rows 8–13 to `.player`, with two
//  empty water rows (6, 7) in between. Almost every spatial helper in `Zones` and
//  every attack-direction helper in `Rules` is parameterised on `Side`.
