//
//  Heuristic opponent that plays like a curious-but-cautious player. It uses ONLY
//  information it has earned in-game (its own grenade history on the player half
//  and any wreckage from intercepted strikes); it never peeks at the player's
//  `board.marks`. The strategy in three beats:
//
//  1. SCOUT — until the player's coastguard column is known (or the coastguard is
//     destroyed), the AI mostly fires grenades at row 8. Each grenade either kills
//     the CG outright (a `.hit`) or rules out one column (a `.miss`).
//  2. PRESS — once the CG's status is resolved, the AI mostly launches missiles
//     and bombers, preferring columns it has confirmed are safe so it can't be
//     intercepted.
//  3. HUNT — between launches the AI occasionally grenades the player's grass
//     (rows 9–13), biased toward safe columns where units are likelier to sit.
//
//  Every choice ends in `randomElement()` over a filtered candidate set, so the
//  player never sees a left-to-right or top-to-bottom sweep — even on repeat play.
